* Prelude Personal Files
** This is not ideal at all, but prelude is quite nice thus far.
- To install prelude, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude
- Using prelude in this manner allows us to keep up with the main prelude repo while keeping our local changes 
** To Install in your personal dir:
*** cd into ~/.emacs.d/personal
*** git clone https://github.com/MichaelMartinez/personal-prelude.git  
*** We can now push and pull from this remote...
